ABSTRACT

This present work aims to build a model for an interconnected business process where each one relates to each other through activities. This business must work for waste management, so that the business rules that will be created develop a relationship between processes and activities. Then, software using these concepts will be created to manage registration systems for employees, customers and waste that are generated by their industries. The system must generate reports consistent with sustainable reality, addressing pre-established standards.
